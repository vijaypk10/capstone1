1: What is the problem you want to solve?

Sites like Quora and Stackexchange allow people to ask any question and get answers from other users.
The problem they face is how to know when a question has already been asked and answered so that
their systms don't fill up with duplicate questions.  

2: Who is your client adn why do they care about this problem?

The client is a hypothetical service similar to these two, though perhaps in a more specific domain.
They woudl use the results of this analysis to direct users with new questions to other questions
that may be sufficiently similar to their own.

3: What data are you going to use for this?

Quora has published a dataset on Kaggle that marks question duplicates.  The dataset is large and
very robust, and ideally marked for this task.

4: In brief, ourlien your approach to solving this problem.

Are you kidding?  My approach is to flail wildly until I get the answer

5: What are your deliverables? (Typically, this would include code along with a paper and/or slide deck)

I will deliver a working system
