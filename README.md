1: Shelter animal population study
Consider shelter animal populations from the point of view of 
commodity overstock. Look at consumer selection criteria, overall
market size (of wanted, not unwanted animals) and other factors.
The goal is to determine if there are strategies that can be found
to reduce unwanted animal populations by exploring the relationships
between those populations and the populations of wanted animals.


2: Happiness as a function of relationships to various countries
Consider the extent to which proximity to various countries influences
happiness in other countries.  Is it good to live in a country that's near
China, the US, or any other country?  Might also consider trade relationships
between countries or any other data that links countries together to get
an idea of how one population benefits or is hurt by those links.

3: Pay fairness in Hollywood
Figure out if women are underpaid in Hollywood.  Look at salary data
in relation to gross receipts, the number of lead actors in a given movie,
the movie genre and other data sets that may be available.
