ideas for first capstone project

1: Shelter animal population study
Consider shelter animal populations from the point of view of 
commodity overstock. Look at consumer selection criteria, overall
market size (of wanted, not unwanted animals) and other factors.
The goal is to determine if there are strategies that can be found
to reduce unwanted animal populations by exploring the relationships
between those populations and the populations of wanted animals.

2: Happiness as a function of relationships to various countries
Consider the extent to which proximity to various countries influences
happiness in other countries.  Is it good to live in a country that's near
China, the US, or any other country?  Might also consider trade relationships
between countries or any other data that links countries together to get
an idea of how one population benefits or is hurt by those links.

3: Pay fairness in Hollywood
Figure out if women are underpaid in Hollywood.  Look at salary data
in relation to gross receipts, the number of lead actors in a given movie,
the movie genre and other data sets that may be available.  

4: Identify peaks and troughs in time series data
The goal is to identify peaks and troughs without the use of arbitrary
measures like sliding windows of fixed size or given length moving
averages.  This is something and humans do visually very easily.

5: Question identification
Solve the stackoverflow problem. When are two questions, though they
may be phrased differently, really the same?

6: Bitcoin investigations
The thing about bitcoin is that the blockchain gives you the ability to track individual
entities through the market.  Doing so would be a project in itself, since people are
likely to spread their transactions through multiple accounts, but that data is public
along with the rest of the block chain.  To my knowledge, there is no other publicly
available dataset that provides a similar opportunitiy.

As an example of what one might look at, it's a commonly accepted notion that consolidation
patterns represent distribution and accumulation between so-called weak and strong hands.
Being able to track entities alongside price action might make it possible to evaluate such
a hypothesis.  One might then be able to generalize the result by making a comparison with 
price data from other assets.  

This would be a labor intensive project, as bitcoin is transacted vis-a-vis many currencies
and other digital assets.  One might have to gather data from all of those and adjust 
it to a common standard, then evaluate the result against the transaction narratives extracted
from the blockchain data. But there may be a holy grail available at the end, proving or disproving
beliefs about weak and strong hands and possibly a predictive model.
